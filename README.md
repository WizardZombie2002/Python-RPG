 An RPG game I made in Python. It's easy to modify and is free to use, but please don't pass it off as your own. 
 I worked very hard on this. 
 The movement from room to room is difficult to work out (As I found out the hard way by testing it on my brother), but here is how it works. 
 To move, you type 'go ' and then one of these directions: Left | Right | Forward | Back | Up | Down, and it must be typed in lower case.
 To use the 'attack command, type 'attack' and then the name of whatever monster is in front of you. 
 The monsters are Crysos, Waiyida and Fieryspite, but to attack them, you must type their names in lower case. 
 The get command is used to pick up weapons and add them to your inventory. 
 To use the get command, type 'get' and then the name of an item. 
 The items currently in the game are: Grasscutter | Ironbark | Ebon Chestplate | Potion | Battlescythe | Deathbrand. 
 As with all of the other things, you must type the name of the item in lower case. 
 EVERYTHING YOU TYPE MUST BE IN LOWER CASE!!! 
 The attack SYSTEM is easier than actually using the attack COMMAND. 
 The attack command initiates a battle, then a message will pop up saying 'Type strike to attack!'. 
 It's pretty self-explanatory, but in case you aren't caught up, you type strike to attack whatever you are attacking.
 Some battles can have you in a run of VERY bad luck, sometimes taking half of your total life out.
 Don't worry.
 I'm currently developing a health potion system, so you can heal up after a bad battle.
 I'm also currently pseudocoding an armour and defense system, so your damage taken can be reduced.
 Enjoy the project, feel free to edit, and have an amazing day.
