 An RPG game I made in Python. It's easy to modify and is free to use, but please don't pass it off as your own. I worked very hard on this. The movement from room to room is difficult to work out (As I found out the hard way), but here is how it works. To move, you type 'go ' and then one of these directions: Left|Right|Forward|Back|Up|Down
