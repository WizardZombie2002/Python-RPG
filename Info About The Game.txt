This game is a basic template that includes: 
Attack System
Movement Between 'Rooms'
Enemies
Items
Consumables
Use Constumables System
Inventory System

But there is so much more that could be added to the game.
If you actually read this, and you make additions to the game's
code, please email the full code:

I would love to see what and how you have done things.
Here are some ideas of what you could do:
Add an equip system
Add an armour system
Make the weapons actually DO something (Right now they are just something to collect)
Add rooms
Add enemies
Add weapons
The possibilities are endless! But please do contact me if you change the code in any way and tell me what you did.
Enjoy!
